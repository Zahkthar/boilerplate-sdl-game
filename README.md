# boilerplate-sdl-game

Project containing a big game skeleton created with SDL.
It brings a preconfig build tool (with xmake).
The main feature is that the project came with modules like a SceneManager,
an InputManager and other things that will be fatally present in all games made with SDL.

The ultimate goal of the project is to be able to concentrate mainly on the gameplay
without worrying about the game's backend, while still having fun coding with the SDL.
